                            <p className="about__lead">I have made this page in order to test and present the skills and knowledge acquired by me during one year of learning web development.</p>
                            <div className="about__main">
                                <p>It took me a while before realizing that web development is <em>the</em> field that I am passionate about and a career path that I want to follow.</p>
                                <p>For almost ten years, I have been working as an analyst, mainly in public sector, but since recently also in a multinational company.</p>
                                <p>Since last September, I have started learning the foundations of web development, devoting most of my free time to this end. I have been using a variety of sources including online courses from Udemy and Frontend Masters.</p>
                                <p>This project presents my level of knowledge so far. It is a SPA made with React (including simple Hooks) and React Router. It fetches public API using Axios. For the styling purposes, I have used Bootstrap 4, customizsed with a help of SCSS.</p>
                                <p>I hope that this website would help me in achieving my primary goal, findig my first job in web development. If not, I do hope that <em>at the very least</em> you will enjoy references to the Star Wars universe.</p>
