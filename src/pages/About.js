                                <p>It took me a while before realizing that web development is <em>the</em> field that I am passionate about and a career path that I want to follow.</p>
                                <p>For almost ten years, I have been working as an analyst, mainly in public sector, but since recently also in a multinational company.</p>
                                <p>Since September 2018, I have been learning web development, devoting most of my free time to this end. I have been using a variety of sources including online courses from Udemy and Frontend Masters.</p>
                                <p>This project presents my level of knowledge in mid 2019. It is a SPA made with React (including simple Hooks) and React Router. It fetches public API using Axios. For the styling purposes, I have used Bootstrap 4, customizsed with a help of SCSS.</p>
                                <p>I do hope that you will enjoy references to the Star Wars universe.</p>
